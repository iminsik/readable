# How to run Readable app

## Run local backend service at port 5001
```
  cd ./reactnd-project-readable-starter/
  npm install && npm start
```

## Run local readable client app at port 3000
```
  cd ./reacdnd-project-client/
  npm install && npm start
```
Your default browser will launch your Readable app at port 3000
Currently, this app is under construction so that you may see the app not mature enough to server in production.

#Enjoy!
